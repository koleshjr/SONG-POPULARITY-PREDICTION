I emerged position 82 out of 535 kagglers and i was proud of myself since it was my first kaggle competition

TAKE AWAYS FROM THIS COMPETITION.
Overfitting was a really a big problem for me. I used blended models which performed better on the public leaderboard but poorly on the private leaderboard. A simple catboost model or lightgbm model would have performed better.

Great lessons learnt from this competition.
